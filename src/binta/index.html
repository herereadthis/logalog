    <h2>Basic Knowledge</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Districts</strong></p>
            <p>The city is divided into a bunch of districts. A good rule of thumb is the lower in number you go, the nicer and more touristy the city gets. Most of the skyscrapers and fancy stores and attractions are in District 1.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>The French</strong></p>
            <p>Because of colonialism, the city bears a lot of French influence. Nobody really harbors ill will or resentment, it's just a part of the history. You will notice lots of French-colonial style buildings, wide, tree-lined avenues with traffic circles, and french-influnced food. Banh Mi is always served on a baguette. Also, when you come across Westerner tourists, they are most likely French.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Climate</strong></p>
            <p>It is very hot and very muggy. It gets bearable by the evening. Because of the hotness of midday, the city wakes up very early to take advantage of cool morning temperatures. Consequently, the city shuts down fairly early and almost nothing is open by 11PM, except for the Backpacker's area.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Traffic</strong></p>
            <p>The traffic signals are mostly a suggestion. The majority of people get around on small 100-125cc motorbikes. It is kind of nuts, but I've almost never seen any road rage. There's a collective understanding that everyone is doing their best.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Getting There</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Airport: T&#226;n S&#417;n Nh&#7845;t (Code: SGN)</strong></p>
            <p>This is the main airport into Saigon. There are no direct flights from America. I recommend a Japanese or Korean Airline to get you there. United Airlines also does partnerships with ANA (Japanese) to get you there too.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Visa</strong></p>
            <p>All US citizens must get a tourist visa to go to Vietnam.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </section>      

<section>
<h2>Money</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Currency</strong></p>
        <p>The current rate is about $1 = 22,000&#273; (VND). The currency is either made of polumer of paper. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Polymer currency: 500,000&#273; ($22.50), 200,000&#273; ($9), 100,000&#273; ($4.50), 50,000&#273; ($2.25), 20,000&#273; ($1), 10,000&#273; (50&#162;)</li>
            <li>Paper currency: 5000&#273; (20&#162;), 1000&#273; (5&#162;), and 500&#273; (2&#162;). There is also a 200&#273; but it's rare because it's basically worthless.</li>
            <li>Here are some prices to expect:
                <ul>
                    <li>A water bottle from a cart vender typically costs 10,000&#273; (50&#162;) or less</li>
                    <li>A lunch entree from a casual restaurant:  80,000&#273; ($3.50)</li>
                    <li>Bottle of domestic beer at a restaurant: 20,000&#273; ($1)</li>
                    <li>Iced coffee from a street vendor: 15,000&#273; (67&#162;)</li>
                    <li>1-night stay at a decent hotel: 600,000&#273; ($27)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Exchanging Cash</strong></p>
        <p>There are ATMs all over the city (only use the ones attached to banks) that will accept your card. If you need to exchange large sums of money (>$1000), it gets trickier.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Credit Cards</strong></p>
        <p>Most places are cash only, but if you go to places that have an cash register, they will typically accpept Visa/Mastercard</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>What to Pack</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Bicycle Helmet</strong></p>
        <p>We will be going on motorbike rides throught the city (never over 20mph). You can buy cheap helmets in the city for about $20, but I generally don't trust them. Reliable helmets are also available to buy, if there's no room in your suitcase.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Easily washable and removable footwear</strong></p>
        <p>You'll notice that you'll be taking your shoes off and putting them back on very often - in people's houses, in temples, and in many fancy boutique shops. Also, you'll occasionally step in puddles.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Plug adaptor</strong></p>
        <p>I got my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Grounded-Universal-Schuko-Adapter-Germany/dp/B004SY5O5K">adapter from amazon</a> but if you forget, they are widely available at the giant supermarkets.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>No need to pack</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Toiletries and sunscreen</strong></p>
        <p>Very cheap, all the brands you know, and widely available. I usually only pack enough toiletries to last me a few nights, in case I get stranded at an airport.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Things worth buying</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Silk</strong></p>
        <p>There's this whole block full of all kinds of silk, and also embroidered/painted silks</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Coffee and Tea</strong></p>
        <p>Very yummy and fairly cheap</p>
    </li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Etiquette</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Tipping</strong></p>
        <p>Nobody tips. Even if you're trying to show appreciation, there's no need. It's just not part of the culture. If you're in a cab, the cabbie will round up to an appropriate denomination depending on what he has or what you have.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Temples</strong></p>
        <p>Take off your shoes.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Beggers</strong></p>
        <p>Do not give money to beggers because if you do, you'll have half a dozen of them following you around for blocks. Most importantly, do not acknowledge their presence. It may seem rude, but it's often hard to differentiate between homeless people who are truly suffering, and professional beggers. If you want to some good deeds, we can visit an orphanage.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>People trying to sell you things</strong></p>
        <p>You will be approached by children and old people trying sell you lottery tickets, or gum, or cigarettes or snacks. A polite "no thank you" will not work. If you talk to them, they will use that as an opportunity to get more attention from you. The best way to get them to leave is to act with complete disinterest. Make them feel invisible.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Chopsticks</strong></p>
        <p>When you are done eating, it's okay to rest your chopsticks horizontally on top of your bowl or on the table. Do not ever leave them stabbed into your food like stakes. Do not slide them back and forth against each other.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Taking pictures</strong></p>
        <p>Unless there's "no photography" signs (e.g. at airport security), it's okay to take pictures anywhere and of anyone. Nobody gets offended or annoyed. However, be mindful of the people around you because there are phone snatchers.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Entering people's houses</strong></p>
        <p>Take off your shoes.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Politics</strong></p>
        <p>Don't talk about politics.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

    <h2>Food &amp; Drink</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Street Food</strong></p>
        <p>I've never really had trouble with street food, but use your own discrestion. In fact, the only times I've ever gotten sick from food in Vietnam was from eating in fancy restaurants.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Durian (S&#7847;u Ri&#7873;ng)</strong></p>
        <p>It's a giant spiky fruit with a yellow pulp. Vietnamese people love this, but I think it tastes horrible and smells horrible. It'll ruin your day.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Tropical Fruits</strong></p>
        <p>Theres a bunch of fruits you will never see in America and they are all super yummy. My favorite is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_mangosteen">mangosteen</a> (m&#259;ng c&#7909;t).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Coffee (C&#224; Ph&#7873;)</strong></p>
        <p>Coffee is typically served two ways, iced black (<em>c&#224; ph&#7873; &#273;en</em>), or iced with sweetened condensed milk (<em>c&#224; ph&#7873; s&#7919;a &#273;&#225;</em>). It's always super strong.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Beer (Bia)</strong></p>
        <p>For some really strange reason, people in Vietnam prefer to drink their beer by pouring room temperature beer over ice in a cup. If you can, ask for bottled cold beer. The selection of beer is very limited: domestic (Saigon, 333), and imports: (Tiger, Heineken, Corona).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Liquor, Wine, Champagne (R&#432;&#7907;u)</strong></p>
        <p>Any alcohol stronger than beer is just called r&#432;&#7907;u. Your best bet is to go to one of those very large supermarkets that stock western goods. Unfortunately, decent cheap champagne is very rare.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Rice Moonshine (R&#432;&#7907;u &#272;&#7871;)</strong></p>
        <p>I won't touch this stuff. I don't want to go blind.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Staying safe and healthy</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Respirators</strong></p>
            <p>We'll have a bunch of them ready, but you'll want to wear one when on a motorbike, to avoid all the dust and smoke</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Soy</strong></p>
            <p>Most vietnamese food does not have soy, and it will be obvious when it does, such as tofu. However, watch out for Banh Mi sandwiches - make a request for the person not to add soy sauce.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Pickpockets and phone snatchers</strong></p>
            <p>Use common sense and you should be okay.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Purse/bag snatchers</strong></p>
            <p>This happens to a lot of people, but can be prevented if you never leave a purse or bag hanging off one shoulder. Across the body at all times! If your bag has external pockets, do not keep anything valuable in them.</p>
        </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Crossing the street</strong></p>
        <p>All the drivers on the road make assumptions of where you will be, and where other drivers will be, so the trick is to be as predictable as possible (don't be frogger). Just walk across slowly in a straight line.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>What to wear</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Daytime</strong></p>
        <p>It is very easy to get sunburned. Many westerners think <em>"hot weather = tank tops + shorts,"</em> and they are easy to spot because they're covered in peeling red skin. When outdoors, it's best to wear loose-fitting clothing that can cover your skin. You will sweat more, but being icky is better than being burnt. This also explains why most people in Vietnam shower at least twice a day. Dress in layers so you can shed the long-sleeved stuff when you are indoors again.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Nighttime</strong></p>
        <p>Anything you damn well please.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Temples</strong></p>
        <p>There are many beautiful temples around the city. While nobody will stop you from entering, it's a good idea to wear something that goes past your knees and covers your shoulders, just to be respectful. However, don't worry too much: people will understand that you are tourists.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>How to get around</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Taxis</strong><br />
        <p>If you take a cab, only get cabs from these two companies: Vinasun or Mai Linh. All other companies are shady and/or overpriced.</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="./vinasun.jpg" class="caption_image" />
            <figcaption>Vinasun</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
            <img src="./mai_linh.jpg" class="caption_image" />
            <figcaption>Mai Linh</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Fare is super cheap. Of these two companies, vehicles come in "4 seat" or "7 seat" cars. The 4 seat cars a little cheaper. Additionally, the cabbies from these two companies typically know some basic English.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Uber</strong></p>
        <p>It's totally usable in Saigon, but I can't vouch for other cities.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>FUTA Bus Lines (Xe Ph&#432;&#417;ng Trang)</strong></p>
        <p><a href="https://futabus.vn/en-US">Website</a></p>
        <p>This is the equivalent of Greyhound, except it's very cheap and fairly reliable. They also have sleeping bed buses if you are making overnight trips</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Vietjet Air</strong></p>
        <p><a href="http://www.vietjetair.com/Sites/Web/en-US/Home">Website</a></p>
        <p>Also known as "Delay Airlines." It is very, very cheap and is the most convenient way to travel around vietnam. Unfortunately, expect every flight to be at least an hour delayed.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Staying Connected</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>SIM Cards</strong><br />
        <p>They are very cheap. You buy a $10 card and have all the data you need, assuming you have an unlocked phone</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Wifi</strong></p>
        <p>Wifi is in practically every store and restaurant. If you ever really need it, just find the nearest cafe, ask anyone working there, "wifi?" and they'll give you access. The only notabe exception where wifi sucks is the airport.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Viber</strong></p>
        <p>This is the preferred calling/messaging app in Vietnam. A secondary option is LINE. Nobody uses WhatsApp or Snapchat.</p>
    </li>
</ul> 
</section>  

<section>
    <h2>Totally worth seeing</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Jade Emporer Pagoda (Ch&#249;a Ph&#432;&#7899;c H&#7843;i)</strong></p>
            <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlsay172aQo">Video</a> |
                <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Phuoc+Hai+Temple+(Emperor+Jade+Pagoda),+73+Mai+Thi+Luu+St.,+Dakao+Ward,+District+1,+%C4%90a+Kao,+District+1,+Ho+Chi+Minh,+Vietnam/@10.7917307,106.6979085,12z/data=!4m5!1m2!2m1!1schua+phuoc+hai!3m1!1s0x317528caf6d7f125:0xda5474988bc2e59c">73 Mai Th&#7883; L&#7921;u, District 1</a></p>
            <p>I don't what's made of jade or who the emporer is, but the English-language tour books call it that. It's a very old temple and looks cool.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Thien Hau Temple (Ch&#249;a B&#224; Thi&#7873;n H&#7853;u)</strong></p>

            <p>This one is located in the Chinatown area of Saigon so it has a lot of Chinese influence</p>
        </li>
        <li>

            <p>There's a lot of dried food, tea, and all sorts of food and snacks, and jewelry. It's also really cool to walk around even if you don't plan on buying anything.</p>

    <h2>What to Avoid</h2>
    <p><em>(This is my personal preference. What I don't like might be things you like)</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Backpacker's Area (Khu Ph&#7889; T&#226;y Ba L&#7891;)</strong></p>
            <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7w-hXIOMTM">Video</a> | <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ph%E1%BA%A1m+Ng%C5%A9+L%C3%A3o,+Qu%E1%BA%ADn+1,+H%E1%BB%93+Ch%C3%AD+Minh,+Vietnam/@10.7683017,106.6924142,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x31752f3de9212357:0xe6320836f82516ba">Ph&#7841;m Ng&#361; L&#227;o Street</a></p>
            <p><em>That video link should explain everything.</em> In Vietnamese, this area is literally translated as "neighborhood city westener backpack" because that is all you find there. I suppose backpackers want to meet other backpackers so they have someone to talk to, or share stories. There are a bunch of hostels and tour companies and nightclubs here. The hostels here cost more than the hotels in any other area of Saigon. However, if you want to go out at night and party, this area is the only part of the city that doesn't shut down after 11PM. Be warned, everything here cost way more than anywhere else.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Ben Thanh Market (Ch&#7907; B&#7871;n Th&#224;nh)</strong></p>
            <p>This this the giant market with a clock tower near the center of the city. It sells souvenirs. It's kinda cool, but the entire place is designed to separate tourists from their money.</p>
        </li>
